# Code for generating figures

* Figure 1: code/fridge/fridge_demo.py 
The depenendecies for this is to download the Hoboware folder from here and place in ~/Documents

* Figure 2: code/fridge/rice_hall_precision_recall_energy.py
All the required code is already contained in the Github repo

* Figure 3: code/hvac/model_setpoint_accuracy.py


* Figure 4: code/fridge/fridge_usage_energy_usage_ratio_outlier.py
It is dependent on `usage_defrost_cycles.csv` which is already there in the Github repository. This CSV can be generated by calling
code/fridge/fridge_compressor_durations_optimised_jul_7.py. It must be noted that `d_new.to_csv("../../data/fridge/usage_defrost_cycles.csv", index_label="home")` should be uncommented! The function is generic.

* Figure 5: code/fridge/fridge_defrost_num_cycles_ratio_outlier.py
It is dependent on `usage_defrost_cycles.csv` which is already there in the Github repository. Remaining instructions same as that for Figure 4.

* Figure 6: code/fridge/fridge_malfunction.py
Remaining things were edited in Preview.

* Figure 7: code/hvac/model_accuracy_nilm_gt_confusion_only_gt.py
It is dependent on data/hvac/minutes_GT.csv; this is generated using the shell script 

* Figure 8:

* Figure 9:

* Figure 10:

* Figure 11: code/hvac/model_accuracy_nilm_gt_confusion_only_nilm.py
It is dependent on:
	1. minutes_*.csv: which is generated by
	2. rf_hvac.pkl: 

* Figure 12:
